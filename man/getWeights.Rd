\title{Get weighted adjancency matrix for linear SEM.
Assumes that \code{X} is zero-centered, which can be done via \code{X=scale(Xoriginal,center=T,scale=F)}.
Estimation is done via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression.}
\usage{
getWeights(X, pa)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An n by p data matrix which is used to estimate the weighted adjacency matrix.}

\item{pa}{A length p list object whose j-th entry gives the support for node j's parent set.}
}
\value{
A p by p weighted adjacency matrix for the linear SEM.
}
